`GeoTox` open-source R software package for characterizing the risk of perturbing molecular targets involved in adverse human health outcomes based on exposure to spatially-referenced stressor mixtures via the GeoTox framework - otherwise known as source-to-outcome-continuum modeling. The package, methods, and case-studies are described in [Messier, Reif, and Marvel, 2024, medRxiv-Preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.24314096).

The GeoTox framework was first described in
[Eccles et al. A geospatial modeling approach to quantifying the risk of exposure to environmental chemical mixtures via a common molecular target. Sci Total Environ. 2023 Jan 10;855:158905.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36152849/)

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("GeoTox")
```

## Development Version

The development version can be installed from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("NIEHS/GeoTox")
```

## Overview

Figure 1 below shows the steps in the source-to-outcome-continuum or GeoTox modeling framework that is capable in the `GeoTox` package. <span style="color: blue;">blue text</span> nodes represent an object and <span style="color: green;">green text</span>, rounded nodes represent a methodology or function required to go from one to the next. The `GeoTox` package uses R S3 object-oriented programming to create the **GeoTox** object. The **GeoTox** object is a list that contains all of the information required to run the analysis including tracking exposure, assays, dose-response, and geospatial referencing.
