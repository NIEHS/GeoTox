`GeoTox` open-source R software package for characterizing the risk of perturbing molecular targets involved in adverse human health outcomes based on exposure to spatially-referenced stressor mixtures. The original framework is described in

[Eccles KM, Karmaus AL, Kleinstreuer NC, Parham F, Rider CV, Wambaugh JF, Messier KP. A geospatial modeling approach to quantifying the risk of exposure to environmental chemical mixtures via a common molecular target. Sci Total Environ. 2023 Jan 10;855:158905. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158905. Epub 2022 Sep 21. PMID: 36152849; PMCID: PMC9979101.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36152849/)

`GeoTox` package represents a significant advancement in environmental risk characterization, providing modular software to facilitate the application and further development of the GeoTox framework for quantifying the relationship between environmental exposures and health outcomes. By integrating geospatial methods with cutting-edge exposure and toxicological frameworks, `GeoTox` offers a robust tool for assessing individual and population-level risks from environmental stressors. 

![Source-to-Outcome Continuum concept supports the GeoTox framework](man/figures/Exposome-Cascade.png)
Toxic effects are mediated through chemicals that alter critical molecules, cells, and physiological processes inside the body. In the same spirit, it is clear that phenotypic outcomes (e.g. disease) at the individual or population level can only occur after a series of source, exposure, and biological dynamics. We refer to this as the **source-to-outcome-continuum**. It follows that if methods and data exist to quantify each step in the sequence, and each step can be integrated into each neighboring step, then individual and population outcomes can be quantified  from spatiotemporally resolved environmental sources and exposures.

## Installation

The package will be on CRAN in the near future - please stay tuned. You can install the development version of GeoTox from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}
pak::pkg_install("NIEHS/GeoTox")
```
